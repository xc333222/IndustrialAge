Industrial Age Mod

Industrial Age is a giant industrial mod that adds over 100+ machines and 500+ items,

Players can gradually evolve from wooden machines at the beginning to large machines later, and can add supplementary mods to expand their gameplay

Here's its Github link: https://github.com/xc333222/IndustrialAge

We will continue to develop more subsidiary mods for them and how to play their base games, and more details can be found in the relevant media platform accounts of "Cave Studio".
